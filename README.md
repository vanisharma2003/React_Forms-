# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- # Flow 
Form -> StudentTable 
Filled data in the form and click submit
StudentTable loads the filled data 
StudentTable also has options to delete and edit every entry present
Form has proper validations and validation code is written in a separate file known as validations.js
